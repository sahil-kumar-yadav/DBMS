# Oracle

## Introduction

### Database
A database is an organized collection of structured data stored electronically in a computer system or any device. A database system allows us to access, manage, and frequently find relevant information. Before the advent of database systems, data was stored using a flat file structure.

The Relational Database system has gained popularity over the flat-file model because it eliminates redundant data. For example, in a flat-file system where employee and contact information are stored in the same file, an employee with multiple contacts would appear in multiple rows.

### Introduction to Oracle
Oracle, developed by Oracle Corporation, is a relational Database Management System (DBMS). Known for its security, scalability, and high performance, OracleDB was created in 1997 and is sometimes referred to as OracleDB. Oracle offers multiple product editions, including:

- Enterprise Edition
- Standard Edition
- Express Edition
- Oracle Lite
- Personal Edition

Oracle was the first database designed for enterprise grid computing and data warehousing. Enterprise grid computing provides a flexible and cost-effective way to manage applications and information. Oracle databases use SQL queries for interaction.

## Features of Oracle Database

OracleDB manages data with an open, complete, and integrated approach. The key features include:

### Availability
OracleDB supports 24x7 availability, thanks to its Oracle Data Guard functionality, which allows a secondary database to serve as a backup in case of primary database failure.

### Security
OracleDB provides robust security features, including Oracle Advanced Security, Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), and Data Redaction. TDE encrypts data at the source and after export, while Redaction occurs at the application level.

### Scalability
OracleDB is scalable with features like Portability and Real Application Clusters (RAC). RAC offers benefits such as:

- Performing upgrades
- Enhancing availability
- Managing quality of service

### Performance
OracleDB includes several performance optimization tools, including:
